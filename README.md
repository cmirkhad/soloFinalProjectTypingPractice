# Typing Practice
Touch typing is howadays one of the most powerful and required skilles. It's known as typing on the keyboard without looking at it, i.e. knowing positions of almost all keys. It's based on mustle memory.<br>
There are a lot of various applications, which help to develop touch typing skills. Some applications are convenient, some not. Web touchtype applications are preferable, some of them are: TypeRacer, monkeytype, fasttyping, livechat, keybr. etc.<br>
My application is based on above ones, also I used some key parts of the code from Web Dev Simplified.
